              <h2>Idea #1: Custom Art Apparel Store</h2>
                <h3>A store for custom, non-licensed apparel made to support smaller artists, who receive a cut of each sale. Most designs are pop culture themed, and the fun modern site theming reflects this.</h3>

              <h2>Idea #2: Grocery Store</h2>
                <h3>One of the smaller grocery stores that does not have wide appeal, but wins over devout customers with better prices and quality items. It's nicheness is embraced by fun, non-corporate branding.</h3>

              <h2>Idea #3: Record Store</h2>
                  <h3>A home for the medium of physical music including cds, vinyl, and their respective devices. It will embrace the retro roots of its subject matter and feature a very 80s "movie theater carpet pattern" vibe.</h3>
