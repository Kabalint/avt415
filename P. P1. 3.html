          <h1>P. P1.3: User Scenario Mapping (Record Store)</h1>
          <h2>The Scenario:
          <h3>Retro Randy is an elderly vinyl collector who is disappointed by the growing change from physical to digital music. It is difficult for him to get out to stores in person and he has mediocre internet literacy. His son learns about the site and shares it with Randy, who checks it out for himself. He is able to easily browse the site and find what he wants and proceeds to purchase records there.
          <br><br>Actor: Randy
          <br>Motivator: Wants to grow his vinyl collection.
          <br>Intention: He wants to shop from a business that truly respects the medium of physical music and has a wide music library.
          <br>Action: Randy browses the website by paying attention to what is featured and also using its filter and search options to get a good sense of what is available.
          <br>Resolution: Randy likes what he sees and purchases records from the site.</h3>
